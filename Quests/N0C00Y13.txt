<ce>                   Hmmph. You're not a guild member.
<ce>                    I really shouldn't give out jobs
<ce>                    to non-members. However, I have
<ce>                    something that I need done that
<ce>                    I don't really want anyone else
<ce>                    in the guild to find out about.
<ce>                    If you do this for me for free,
<ce>                     I'll spread it around that you
<ce>                       are our kind of %ra. What
<ce>                            do you say %pcf?

<ce>                        Go away. You bother me.

<ce>                       My name is _questgiver_.
<ce>                  There is an ancient text supposedly
<ce>                         hidden in ___dungeon_.
<ce>              Bring it back to me within =traveltime_ days
<ce>                    and I'll consider the job done.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Excellent. I remembered to warn you not
<ce>                to read this, didn't I?  Could be quite
<ce>                dangerous if you pronounced "nagog" with
<ce>            the hard g, as laymen are apt.  Well, thanks for
<ce>                     your help, %pcn. Keep this up
<ce>                 and we'll consider you for membership
<ce>                          in the Mages Guild.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Certainly I remember you, %pcf. You brought me that text, right?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>               I can't imagine a simpler assignment than
<ce>               the one I gave you -- just find a rare old
<ce>               scroll. Now, I can't imagine a reason why
<ce>                    I should keeping talking to you.

<ce>                      This must be the parchment
<ce>                     _questgiver_ sent you to find.

<ce>                      As you read the final word,
<ce>                      a frigid blast almost whirls
<ce>                      the paper out of your hands.
