QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                            I am _qgiver_.
<ce>                   As a rule, only guild members are
<ce>                   paid for work. However, I do have
<ce>                  a small task that needs to be done.
<ce>                    If you were to do it for free, I
<ce>                    would put in a good word for you
<ce>                    with the guild. Are you willing?
                                     <--->
<ce>                       I am _qgiver_. Guild work
<ce>                   for guild members only. However, I
<ce>                  do have a small job that nobody else
<ce>                   is willing to do. One of our more
<ce>                    eccentric masters is absolutely
<ce>                    insistent we get her a sample of
<ce>                       _ingredient_, which we are
<ce>                   fresh out of. If you got some for
<ce>                     me, I would be very grateful.
<ce>                      You standing with the guild
<ce>                         would surely improve.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     Should have known. I am tired
<ce>                       of this conversation %pcn.
<ce>                               Good day.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      An excellent attitude %pcf.
<ce>                       I need some _ingredient_.
<ce>                     The only specimen I know of at
<ce>                      the moment is to be found in
<ce>                         ___dungeon_. You have
<ce>                  =traveltime_ days to bring it back.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     I've seen better samples. Did
<ce>                   you sit on it the whole way back?
<ce>                     In any event, it will do. I'll
<ce>                    make sure that you are spoken of
<ce>                     with favor in the guild halls.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That crazy mage at the Guild insists that ___dungeon_ has the best _ingredient_

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I haven't forgotten you, %pcf. You're the %ra who got the _ingredient_.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>               It wasn't a very difficult thing I asked
<ce>                      you to do, %pcf. Just get me
<ce>                 some _ingredient_. And you couldn't do
<ce>                      that. Why should I waste my
<ce>                             breath on you?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt, I was
 asked to find a sample of
 _ingredient_ that is
 supposed to be hidden away
 in ___dungeon_.
 _qgiver_ of the Mages
 Guild of ___qgiver_
 gave me =traveltime_ days to get
 it back to %g2.

Message:  1040
<ce>                     This must be the _ingredient_
<ce>                      _qgiver_ asked you to find.

Message:  1080
<ce>                     As a special thanks from the
<ce>                    Mages Guild, allow me to present
<ce>                   you with this map to ___newdung_.
<ce>                   I understand that people like you
<ce>                       salivate over such things.
